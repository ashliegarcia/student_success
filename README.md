# student_success_project
This project involved creating datasets by entering the student's progress (i.e. Not Completed, In Progresss, Completed) based on their academic report. The dataset was created with visuals by using conditional formatting and icon sets. This reprository includes an excel file of the freshman 17 cohort.
